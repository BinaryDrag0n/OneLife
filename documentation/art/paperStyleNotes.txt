Cut/tear out paper shape using plain white paper, scan in on black background.

Clean up black and white areas of scan to remove noise.  Paper texture
is not important at this stage, though detail along the edge is.  We're
essentially making a black and white mask.

Use this mask to select a paper-texture region from hintPaperBaseTexture.xcf

This is the correct color and texture for paper slips in the game.

Use this same mask to select a region from a solid black area.  Blur this
black shape to make a drop shadow

Drop shadows are Gaussian Blur, radius 7, with layer opacity 66.7%
